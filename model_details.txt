Explanation of data engineering and create ML model.

tools used: Jupyter notebook.
libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn and matplotlib



1. import the required libraries.

2. load the dataset using padas

3. check the issue null values in dataset

4. check the full information of the dataset using pandas info() method

5. Countplot of the 'Result' shows the count of the -1 and 1 in the dataset. looks like an unbalanced data.

6. check the corelation of the result with each feature.

7. plot the heatmap for corelation visualization.

8. consider the features that has positive and negative corelation.

9. collected the features to train.

10. split the dataframe using sklearn model.

11. import the Random forest classifier

12. train the data

13. check the predictions on X test data

14. perform the evaluation metrics

15. perform the hyper parameter tuning using grid search CV.

16. you can see the model performacne has slightly increased with best parameters that our grid shows.

17. create a dataframe for keys.

18. create a dataframe to collect result information.

19. concatinate the dataframes to get final df.

20. upload final df.
